# kontur.nvim

## Intro

`kontur.nvim` provides powerful and intuitive text objects to select and operate on blocks of text based on their structure. It understands both code indentation and Markdown-style headings, allowing you to work with logical blocks seamlessly.

The basic concept is to select neighboring lines of text base on the indent level under the cursor.

When searching the lines, the *(i)side* operation means all the neighboring lines whose indent level is equal or lower than the line under the cursor.

And the *(a)round* operation means all the neighboring lines whose indent level is equal or lower than the line under the cursor, plus a upmost line or a downmost line which has a lower indent level if existed.

Including any empty line when searching.

UPDATE:

Now we can select content by Markdown title level.

Using `vit` to select all lines under the nearest Markdown title, and use `vat` to select all lines under the Markdown title including the title itself.



## Config

The default keystroke for indent line is `i` and `I`. If you want to use another pair of character, you can set the config object:

```lua
require("kontur").setup({
    indent_object_char = 'i', -- now use `ii` or `ai` to select indent
    title_object_char = 't', -- now use `it` or `at` to select title
})
```

## Usage

Here is a function:

```lua
ðŸ®›local function test()
ðŸ®›  print(1)
â–ˆ  print(2)
ðŸ®›  print(3)
ðŸ®›end
```

use `vii` to select function body (Thay are have the same indent level):

```lua
ðŸ®›local function test()
â–ˆ  print(1)
â–ˆ  print(2)
â–ˆ  print(3)
ðŸ®›end
```

use `vai` to select all function definition (exluding the upmost line with a less indent level, but not downmost one):

```lua
â–ˆlocal function test()
â–ˆ  print(1)
â–ˆ  print(2)
â–ˆ  print(3)
ðŸ®›end
```
use `vaI` to select all function definition (including the upmost and downmost line with a less indent level):

```lua
â–ˆlocal function test()
â–ˆ  print(1)
â–ˆ  print(2)
â–ˆ  print(3)
â–ˆend
```


Here are some markdown texts:

```markdown
ðŸ®›# Header 1
ðŸ®›- List 1
ðŸ®›  - Sub list 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 2
ðŸ®›  - Sub list 3
ðŸ®›
ðŸ®›# Header 2
```

use `vii` to select sub lists (without the empty line):

```markdown
ðŸ®›# Header 1
ðŸ®›- List 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 2
â–ˆ  - Sub list 3
ðŸ®›
ðŸ®›# Header 2
```
use `viI` to select sub lists (including the empty line):

```markdown
ðŸ®›# Header 1
ðŸ®›- List 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 2
â–ˆ  - Sub list 3
â–ˆ
ðŸ®›# Header 2
```
use `vai` to select List 1 and Sub lists (without the empty line):

```markdown
ðŸ®›# Header 1
â–ˆ- List 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 2
â–ˆ  - Sub list 3
ðŸ®›
ðŸ®›# Header 2
```
use `vaI` to select List 1 and Sub lists (including the empty line):

```markdown
ðŸ®›# Header 1
â–ˆ- List 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 2
â–ˆ  - Sub list 3
â–ˆ
ðŸ®›# Header 2
```

## Select by Markdown titles

use `vit` to select all lines under the nearest Markdown title:

```Markdown
ðŸ®›# Header 1
â–ˆ- List 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 1
â–ˆ  - Sub list 2
â–ˆ  - Sub list 3
â–ˆ
ðŸ®›# Header 2
```
